Hi! Welcome to my personal web site. 
I live in Brooklyn, New York with my wife and daughter. I was born in 
New York City and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey.

I am a scientist, scholar, and writer whose career has focused on 
research in the areas of labor, education, artificial intelligence, and machine
learning.

I am familiar with a wide range of machine learning algorithms, and I have
extensive experience with large data sets, statistical analysis 
including regression analysis and propensity score matching, cluster analysis,
database systems, and text processing. I am the author of a book on 
neural networks.

I have experience with a wide range of specialized and general purpose 
programming languages, including Python (and Scikit-Learn), R, Stata, 
SAS, Perl, and Lisp. I have strong knowledge of and experience with the design, 
conduct, and analysis of experiments.

I am the author or co-author of many publications, including 
peer-reviewed articles that apply machine learning and data science 
to educational and labor market data.
