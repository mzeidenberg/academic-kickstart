Hi! Welcome to my personal web site. 
I live in Brooklyn, New York with my wife and daughter. I was born in 
New York City and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey.

I am a scientist, scholar, and writer whose career has focused on 
research in the areas of labor, education, artificial intelligence, and machine
learning.

I am familiar with a wide range of statistical and machine learning algorithms, 
and I have extensive experience with large data sets, statistical analysis 
including regression analysis and propensity score matching, cluster analysis,
database systems, and text processing. I am the author of a book on 
neural networks.

In my social science work, I focus on research and program evaluation in workforce development and 
training, labor markets, income security, and higher education. I am currently working on a 
study for the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) that focuses on analyzing the career trajectories 
of workers to see how these trajectories can inform the design of career pathway programs. 

I have also worked on site impact studies for the Pathways for Advancing Careers and Education 
(PACE) randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation of career pathways for the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I was on the analysis team for the Green Jobs 
and Health Care evaluation, which also looked at career pathways programs. He is 
currently working on the Career Pathways Intermediate Outcomes (CPIO) Study, 
which is HHS’s follow-on study for PACE and the related Health Profession Opportunity Grants 
(HPOG) study, as well as its follow-up study (HPOG 2), which arealso sponsored by HHS, 
and is applying techniques from machine learning to that study. 

I was a principal investigator for Abt’s RCT for the Robin Hood College Success Prize, 
which measured the impacts of behavioral interventions delivered through smartphone apps 
on students at two community colleges. I have co-authored papers on the I-BEST program in 
Washington State, on worker mobility over the course of the career 
(using social sequence analysis), on mobility within various industries 
in the service sector, and on progression in college. I have worked heavily 
with administrative data on educational and labor market outcomes, as well 
as with survey data. I have also published peer-reviewed articles that apply 
machine learning and data science to educational and labor market data.

On the technical side, I have experience with a wide range of specialized and general purpose 
programming languages, including Python (and Scikit-Learn), R, Stata, 
SAS, Perl, and Lisp. I have strong knowledge of and experience with the design, 
conduct, and analysis of experiments.

I have six years of experience teaching at the college level, having served for all of that 
time as the primary instructor for computer programming classes. I also taught an artificial
intelligence class and assisted in a class on natural language processing.
