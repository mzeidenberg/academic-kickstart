Hi! Welcome to my personal web site. 
I live in Brooklyn, New York with my wife and daughter. I was born in 
New York City and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey.

I am a scientist, scholar, and writer whose career has focused on 
research in the areas of labor, education, artificial intelligence, and machine
learning.
