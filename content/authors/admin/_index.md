Hi, I'm Matt Zeidenberg; welcome to my personal web site. I'm a data scientist, computer scientist, sociologist, and writer living in Brooklyn, New York with my wife and daughter. I have a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UW) and another Ph.D. in Computer Science (with an emphasis on machine learning and natural language processing), also from the UW, as well as a BA in Physics, from Harvard. I was born in New York City and grew up in Teaneck, New Jersey.

I work at Abt Associates, where I research workforce development and education, primarily for federal agencies and private foundations. Previously I worked at the Community College Research Center at Columbia University (2006-2014) and the Center on Wisconsin Strategy at the University of Wisconsin (1991-2006).

I also taught introductory computer programming at the University of Wisconsin (1985-1991) and authored a book on artificial neural networks in artificial intelligence.

These are some of the technologies I have experience with: Lisp, Python, R, Stata, SAS, SQL (various variants including MySQL), Javascript, HTML, and LaTeX.
