	abstract = {Despite copious research on the labor market returns to college, very little has adequately modeled the pathways of non-completers or compared their outcomes with those of award-holders. In this paper, we present a novel method for linking non-completers with completers according to their program of study. We use this method to calculate the labor market returns to programs of study, accounting for those who obtain an award and those who do not. We use a large dataset of community college transcripts matched with earnings data. We find that different classification systems – by algorithm, intent or goal – yield very different enrollment patterns across programs. Importantly, these classifications make a substantial difference to earnings patterns. Returns vary by program completion and by program non-completion. Consequently, combining completers and non-completers yields a new pattern of returns. We find that the variance in returns by subject of study is reduced when we combine data on completers and non-completers. In particular, the large returns to nursing awards are substantially lower when we account for the probability of completing a nursing program and the returns to not completing a nursing program. In addition, progression per se does not lead to higher earnings for non-completers: progressing further in a nursing program is no different from accumulating general college credits. If validated, these findings have significant implications for policies on program choice and on student retention policies.},

This study focuses on all of the associate degree programs within one state?s community college system and measures the extent of excess credits within each program.Method:I created a measure of the number of excess credits earned relative to all credits earned and measured the extent to which colleges and programs vary in the levels of excess credits. Within particular academic programs, such as business, nursing, and general studies, I generated measures of the extent to which program-related and general education courses create excess credits. I examined the transcripts of some students who have earned excess credits, to see specifically what they did.Results:I take no normative position on the usefulness or harm of excess credits, but instead explore some of the factors that may generate them.Contribution:I suggest some policies that might be implemented to reduce excess credits, if desired.},

	abstract = {With their open access admission policies, low tuition costs, and convenient locations, community colleges are designed to make college accessible to all. They strive to meet three main goals. The first is to teach marketable vocational skills, the second is to provide the first two years of a four-year bachelor’s degree program, and the third is to provide continuing education and enrichment for community residents. This paper covers issues that are relevant to the community college mission of helping prepare a skilled workforce for jobs offering reasonable wages. After providing an overview about community colleges and their students, the paper discusses the types of remedial education programs that are most likely to provide the large number of underprepared students enrolled in community colleges with the skills to advance to college-level courses. It considers the growing phenomenon of dual enrollment that enables students to earn both high school and college credit for courses while still in high school. It addresses the ways that community colleges can support local labor markets and regional economic development and their efforts to build career pathways for workers. It describes the growing role of community colleges in online education, and it reviews the financing of community colleges. The paper also discusses issues related to community college persistence and completion, and it cites evidence of the market value of the education and credentials the colleges provide. Finally, it considers the usefulness of the American community college as a model for other countries seeking to develop institutions that serve similar functions.},

Despite the simplicity of this economic model, complex dynamics both in the economics (prices, market share etc) and in the transmission system characteristics (blackouts, reliability etc) are found. Depending on the values of the control parameters (the price enhancement factor, the critical margin and the Minimal Acceptable Rate of Return) the system can be in various states with vastly differing properties. These states are characterized by power law tails in the failure sizes in one limit and exponential tails with extremely high frequency of failures in the other limit. At least some of these control parameters can be thought of as regulatory based and could therefore be directly influenced by reliability considerations. © 2010 IEEE.},

The Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) states that at any time, the price of a security fully captures all known information about that stock, so the price behaves like a random walk in time, except when there are changes in information. We test whether a nonlinear statistical method, error back propagation, can do better than chance in forecasting stock trends. An error back propagation model is estimated at different levels of time aggregation (daily and monthly) on stock price and stock index returns. This paper brings forth some new and encouraging results on the ability of neural network models to predict the direction of stock price movements and to account for some of the nonlinearities found in stock return data.},
