	abstract = {We examine the careers of a nationally representative US cohort of young adults using sequence analysis and information-theoretic techniques to describe these careers’ structure and how this structure might inform differences in wage mobility.  We operationalise the career as a sequence of industry-occupation pairs observed quarterly.  We investigate how the content of these pairs and their organisation over time relate to future mobility.  We perform the analysis across three different mobility groups, one of which is characterised by persistent low-wage work.  Contrary to what one might expect, low-wage work is not typified by a lack of structure, even in many of the careers in which the worker is weakly attached to the labour market.  Using clustering techniques customised to this problem, we build a typology of careers within three groups of workers defined by their wage mobility.  We find significant variation within, as well as similarity across the three groups, enhancing our understanding of careers with different levels of mobility.},

	abstract = {Despite copious research on the labor market returns to college, very little has adequately modeled the pathways of non-completers or compared their outcomes with those of award-holders. In this paper, we present a novel method for linking non-completers with completers according to their program of study. We use this method to calculate the labor market returns to programs of study, accounting for those who obtain an award and those who do not. We use a large dataset of community college transcripts matched with earnings data. We find that different classification systems – by algorithm, intent or goal – yield very different enrollment patterns across programs. Importantly, these classifications make a substantial difference to earnings patterns. Returns vary by program completion and by program non-completion. Consequently, combining completers and non-completers yields a new pattern of returns. We find that the variance in returns by subject of study is reduced when we combine data on completers and non-completers. In particular, the large returns to nursing awards are substantially lower when we account for the probability of completing a nursing program and the returns to not completing a nursing program. In addition, progression per se does not lead to higher earnings for non-completers: progressing further in a nursing program is no different from accumulating general college credits. If validated, these findings have significant implications for policies on program choice and on student retention policies.},

	abstract = {Objective:Excess credits earned by college students, over and above those required to complete their programs of study, have become increasingly a subject of interest and concern. There has been almost no research on the extent of these credits. This study focuses on all of the associate degree programs within one state?s community college system and measures the extent of excess credits within each program.Method:I created a measure of the number of excess credits earned relative to all credits earned and measured the extent to which colleges and programs vary in the levels of excess credits. Within particular academic programs, such as business, nursing, and general studies, I generated measures of the extent to which program-related and general education courses create excess credits. I examined the transcripts of some students who have earned excess credits, to see specifically what they did.Results:I take no normative position on the usefulness or harm of excess credits, but instead explore some of the factors that may generate them.Contribution:I suggest some policies that might be implemented to reduce excess credits, if desired.},
